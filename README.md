# Lung Cancer Risk Prediction System 🫁📱

This project aims to provide an easy-to-use, machine learning–based lung cancer risk prediction system that enables individuals to assess their risk level based on a set of symptoms. The system is accessible via both a **web interface (Streamlit)** and a **mobile application (Android)**.

## 🔍 Overview

Early detection of lung cancer can save lives. This project leverages a Random Forest Classifier to predict whether a person is at **high risk** or **low risk** of lung cancer, based on key symptoms and demographic information.

The prediction system is deployed through:
- 🌐 **Web App**: Built using Streamlit for user-friendly interaction.
- 📱 **Android App**: Developed using Android Studio with a Python backend API for mobile accessibility.
